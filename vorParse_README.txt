The python code included is designed to increase the legibility of VORLAX input files
Please use the given excel file to change the properties of the wanted VORLAX input file.

Requirements:
1. Python 3
2. Numpy
3. tkinter

The python code currently only generates a text file for VORLAX input. It does included
code to parse the VORLAX.LOG file, if you so desire.

Follow these steps for the file generator:
1. When the file selection window opens, select the EXCEL file containing all vorlax data
for your plane.
2. Select the folder where you want the vorlax input file to be generated
3. Enter the name of the vorlax folder into the command window when prompted
Double check the input file to ensure proper generation when finished.

To run the file generator and input it into vorlax in 1 step, run the vorParse.bat file.
1. Follow the same steps for the file generator.
	[WARNING]:Ensure the output folder is the same folder as this .bat file!
2. When prompted for an input file, enter the name of the vorlax input file generated by python
3. When prompted for an output file, enter the name of the vorlax output file (*.csv)
